    In Edinburgh, as in other cities, the "bike sharing" system works - 
    there are stations with bikes in the city, you can borrow one and 
    then return it at another station. The problem is that in some 
    stations bikes regularly accumulate and in others they are missing. 
    The bike operator, Just Eat Cycles, has commissioned a project 
    to make the system more efficient. As a data analyst,your task is
